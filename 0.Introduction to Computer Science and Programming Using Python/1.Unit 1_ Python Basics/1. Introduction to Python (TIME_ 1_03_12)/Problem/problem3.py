# Problem 3
# 15.0/15.0 points (graded)
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

# Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order.
#For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print:
# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

# In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print:
# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

        present = present + s[i + 1]
        # print (present)
        if len(present) > morelength:
